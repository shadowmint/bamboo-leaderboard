This is a continuous integration plugin for Atlassian Bamboo. 

It provides a better visualization for user commit and testing history than
the standard 'users' page.

It was created as part of the May 2012 Fedex Day at iiNet and kindly donated
as open source so we can spread the goodness around!

Quickstart for hacking:

1. Download the atlassian sdk into ~/atlas
https://developer.atlassian.com/display/DOCS/Installing+the+Atlassian+Plugin+SDK

2. Go into the source folder and run the application
cd ~/bamboo-leaderboard
~/atlas/bin/atlas-run 

3. Open a new tab and start the cli
cd ~/bamboo-leaderboard
~/atlas/bin/atlas-cli

4. Generate an eclipse project
cd ~/bamboo-leaderboard
~/atlas/bin/atlas-mvn eclipse:eclipse

5. Open eclipse and import the project in ~/bamboo-leaderboard

6. Jump into the cli and install the plugin by running 'pi'

7. Hack away in eclipse! 

8. Reload the plugin.
In the cli run 'pi' (plugin install)
Open the localhost dev: http://localhost:6990/bamboo/
Shift reload to reload the plugin 

9. Checkout the leaderboard!
http://localhost:6990/bamboo/plugins/servlet/board
http://localhost:6990/bamboo/plugins/servlet/board/home/user
   
10. Install the actual plugin on a live bamboo server~
TODO --> Just build and copy the files.
